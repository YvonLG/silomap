# silomap
A dash website to showcase a school machine learning/ computer vision project on satellite imagery.
The website uses a model we developed to detect industrial silos. The site was never meant to be online and the performances are
terrible if it doesn't run locally due partially to the way a built it and the way dash works.

The user can select an region on the left and observe the result of the model on the right.
